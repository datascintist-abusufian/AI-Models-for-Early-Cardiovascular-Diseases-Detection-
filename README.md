AI Models for Early Cardiovascular Disease Detection and Mortality Prediction

This repository hosts an AI-powered platform for early detection and mortality prediction of cardiovascular diseases. The tool leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning models to improve clinical diagnostics and patient outcomes through timely and accurate predictions.

Access the live application here: Streamlit App.

🚀 Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate mortality prediction can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare systems and save lives.

This application integrates AI models designed for:
	1.	Early Disease Detection: Identifies early-stage cardiovascular anomalies using patient data.
	2.	Mortality Prediction: Estimates mortality risk based on multi-modal clinical and imaging data.

🔍 Key Features
	1.	Interactive User Interface: Easy-to-use Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.
	2.	AI Models:
	•	Transformer-based models for multi-modal data.
	•	Machine Learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.
	•	Deep Learning frameworks (CNN, ResNet) for imaging data analysis.
	3.	Multi-Modal Data Integration: Combines clinical data, EHR records, and imaging datasets for robust predictions.
	4.	Explainability: Model transparency using SHAP, Grad-CAM, and Integrated Gradients to assist clinicians in decision-making.

🏥 Clinical Applications
	•	Risk Stratification: Categorize patients based on the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases.
	•	Early Intervention: Aid healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients.
	•	Mortality Analysis: Accurately Predict long-term mortality risk to improve follow-up care plans.
